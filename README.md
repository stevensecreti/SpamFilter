# SpamFilter
## Overview
- A very basic email spam classifier created using Multinomial Naive Bayes
- This spam filter was created by following the subsection of a course found on udemy linked below. The code is not identical to that which was showcased in the course, and some additional normalization testing was performed in this notebook.
